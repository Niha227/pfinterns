      <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are transformative technologies reshaping numerous industries. This article provides an overview of these technologies, their applications, and recent advancements.</p>

      <h2>1. What is AI?</h2>
      <p>AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Narrow AI:</strong> Specialized in one task, such as voice assistants or recommendation systems.</li>
        <li><strong>General AI:</strong> Hypothetical AI that can understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a broad range of tasks at human-level capabilities.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. What is Machine Learning?</h2>
      <p>ML is a subset of AI that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> Uses labeled data to train models and make predictions.</li>
        <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> Finds hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in input data.</li>
        <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> Trains algorithms to make a sequence of decisions by rewarding desired behaviors and punishing undesired ones.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Recent Advancements</h2>
      <p>Recent developments in AI and ML include breakthroughs in natural language processing, computer vision, and autonomous systems.</p>
